# Using cloud solution to build mac

My use-case is that i need to be able to build mac apps from windows 10 machines directly in the cloud..

We have the problem as a development team we have inherited a new mobile application into the team and one very old Macbook Air lap-top


## Mac In Cloud

We don't want to buy any new Macs unfortunatly, so we are going to need to use a cloud resource. After a little look around we found https://www.macincloud.com/.
